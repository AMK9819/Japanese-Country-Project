                <h2><b>What is the History Between the Religion of Islam and Japan?</b></h2>
                <p><b>Japans history with Islam is not as known compared 
                      to its history with the philosophy of Confucianism, and the religion of 
                      Buddhism, Shintoism, and Christianity. But that's also what makes the history interesting. 
                      Islam has been in the background of Japanese history and relations officially happened in 1887.
                      The history between Islam/Muslims and Japan is young but it is also rich and interesting and worth exploring as the world 
                      has become much more globalized than ever before.</b></p>

                  <h2><b>The First Japanese Muslim, Shotaro Noda </b></h2>
                  <p><b>In 1887 Prince Komatsu Akihito visited Istanbul in the First
                    official meeting between Japan and the Ottoman Empire. A delegation was organized 
                    Two years later by Sultan Abdulhamid and they got on the Ertugrul Frigate to Japan in
                    July 1889. The Ertugrul Frigate had arrived in Japan's Yokohama in June 1890. Upon arrival the
                    fleet commander Osman Pasha had presented a letter from Sultan Abd√ºlhamid regarding priviledges and gifts
                    to the Japanese emperor. After 3 months and many meetings in Japanthe delegation left Yokohama to return to Istanbul,
                    but on the way to Kobe, the Ertugrul Frigate crashed and sunk due to bad weather.
                    In response, Japan launched an aid campaign for the survivors of the Frigate. A
                    plan was then established that the survivors would be sent back to Istanbul on two Japanese warships
                     When the ship was on its way to Kobe The Frigate encountered bad weather and sunk
                    Shotaro Noda was chosen to carry out this plan. When Noda arrived in Istanbul Sultan Abdulhamid
                    wanted him to stay to teach him Turkish and teach Japanese to other Ottoman officials. Noda felt grateful
                    as the Ottomans had treated him well during his stay and had converted to Islam on May 21, 1891 (Bulut).

                    <p><b>A small Muslim community began forming in Japan as several hundred refugees from Central Asia
                      (Uzbek, Kazak, Kirghiz, etc.) came to Japan during the Bolshevik Revolution. During WWII the Japanese
                      Military Government began setting up research centers on Islam, this was motivated by the Muslim communities
                      that were present in China and Southeast Asia that the Japanese Army was occupying. During this period over one 
                      hundred books and journals on Islam were being published between 1935-1943 (Bushra).This interest was motivated by anti-Western
                      and anti-communist views as well as economic power to appeal to Muslim countries. It went as far as suggesting that 
                      many Japanese people would be willing to convert to Islam, including the emperor. Although given the context of the situation, 
                      it was most likely a strategy to keep Muslims on Japans side (William).

                    <h2><b>The Many Translations of the Quran</b></h2>
                    <p><b>In Japan, there had been many translations of the Qur'an, and most of them
                      were done by Japanese non-muslims. According to Abu Bakr Morimoto, an Islamic professor
                      in Japan, The first translation was published in 1920, the translator was Keu-iche Sakamoto
                      who was a graduate of Tokyo University's Department of Literature. There was a second translation of the
                      Qur'an was done in 1938 and published in a single volume under the title "The Holy Qur'an, the Canon of Islam". The third
                      one of the more notable translations of the Qur'an was done in 1950 by Shumei Okawa, a Japanese political theorist who 
                      helped shape Japanese government propaganda and was tried as a war criminal in 1945, although charges were dropped on 
                      grounds of insanity. The fourth translator of the Qur'an was done by Toshihiko Izutsu in 1957 and was done in three separate volumes.
                      In 1970 there was a fifth translation of the Qur'an done by two non-muslim professors at Osaka University. Finally, a Japanese Muslim
                      began translating the Quran whose name was Haji Umar Mita. Mita translated the Qur'an in 1972 with the help of the Muslim World League.
                      This translation was the only one that had every Ayah in Arabic and a separate Japanese translation with detailed notes on the meaning of each verse (Bushra).

                        World War II. But during the occupation of Japan in 1945, the organization was disbanded. A new organization
                        was later created by the name of the Association for Islamic Studies. The Islamic Center is another organization
                        and it is the third most important place for Islamic activity in Japan after the Kobe Masjid and the Tokyo Masjid. The Islamic
                        Cultural Society was founded by Abu Bakr Morimoto in 1974 it concentrates on the publication of Islamic literature and its translation
                        into Japanese. The Japan Islamic Congress was established by Dr. Shawqi Futaki and the organization lead to the foundation of the
                        Japan Islamic Institute building in 1980 (Bushra). <br><br>

                          The majority of Muslims that reside in Japan are from overseas, there are approximately 
                          10,000 Japanese Muslims living in Japan and 120,000 overseas Muslims. There are over 90 masjids throughout Japan but most
                          Japanese people are unaware of their existence given that Muslims are such a small minority in Japan. The masjids in Japan 
                          have been open to tours that allow Japanese to participate(Hirofumi). Three notable Japanese Muslims are Naoki Qayyim Yamamoto, Hassan Ko Nakata, and Ahmad Maeno.
                          Naoki Yamamoto, motivated by his mothers focus on diversity and being accepting of religions, had decided to study Islam and has traveled to countries like Jordan, Egypt, Indonesia,
                          Malaysia, Pakistan among others, and studied Islamic culture. He currently works at Ibn Haldun University in Turkey(‚ÄúIn His Own Words: Qayyim Naoki Yamamoto.‚Äù). Hassan Ko Nakata is a more controversial figure. He was an
                          Islamic Law professor at Doshisha University who, at first, expressed support for ISIS publically and became a key intermediary during a hostage crisis between Japan and ISIS militants. Hassan Ko Nakata
                          has since disavowed ISIS(Antoni). Ahmad Maeno started his studies on Islam as an exchange student in Australia after he met a Muslim family.
                          currently, he is the head of the Tokyo Masjid (DOPStv). </b>
